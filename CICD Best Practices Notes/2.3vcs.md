# **All Project Assets Are in Source Control**

## **1. Traditional Setup (Anti-Pattern)**

Many organizations store project-related files in scattered locations. This is what we aim to avoid.

## Diagram: **Scattered Files Without Version Control**#

```
+---------------------+         +------------------+         +--------------------+
| Developer Laptop A  |         | Developer Laptop B|         | Wiki/Shared Server |
| - Deployment script |         | - Test Data       |         | - Configuration    |
+---------------------+         +------------------+         +--------------------+
          |                               |                            |
          v                               v                            v
+---------------------+         +------------------+         +--------------------+
| Code Repository     |  <--x-- | Missing Files    |   <--x-- | Missing History   |
| (Source code only)  |         | No Audit Trail   |         | Inconsistent State |
+---------------------+         +------------------+         +--------------------+

```

### Issues:

1. Deployment scripts are on one developer’s laptop.
2. Test data is on another machine.
3. Configuration values are on a shared wiki.
4. There’s no central place where all files exist, leading to inconsistencies.

---

## **2. Best Practice: All Assets in Source Control**

To resolve these issues, every asset related to the application lifecycle is moved to a version control system (e.g., Git).

### Diagram: **Centralized Version Control**

```
+------------------------------------+
|         Git Repository             |
|------------------------------------|
| Source Code                        |
| Build Scripts                      |
| Test Data                          |
| Pipeline Definitions               |
| Configuration Files                |
| Database Schemas                   |
| Infrastructure Scripts (IaC)       |
| Documentation                      |
+------------------------------------+
            ^
            |
+-----------------+    +-----------------+    +-----------------+
| Developer A     |    | Developer B     |    | Developer C     |
| Clones Repo     |    | Clones Repo     |    | Clones Repo     |
+-----------------+    +-----------------+    +-----------------+

```

### Benefits:

1. **Centralization:** All files are stored in a single place, making them accessible to the entire team.
2. **Traceability:** Changes to any file are logged, with a full history of who made what changes and why.
3. **Reproducibility:** Anyone can recreate the entire application environment using the files in the repository.

---

## **3. Repository Structure Example**

Here’s an example of how a repository could be organized to include all assets.

```
project-repo/
├── src/                    # Application source code
├── build/                  # Build scripts
├── tests/                  # Unit and integration tests
├── config/                 # Configuration files for environments (dev, prod)
├── infra/                  # Infrastructure scripts (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation)
├── pipelines/              # CI/CD pipeline definitions
├── scripts/                # Deployment, cleanup, and other scripts
├── db/                     # Database schemas and update scripts
└── docs/                   # Documentation

```

## **4. Workflow Visualization**

### **Traditional Workflow: With Scattered Assets**

```
+------------------+         +------------------+         +------------------+
| Developer A      |  --->   | Developer B      |  --->   | Shared Resources |
| Code + Script    |         | Only Test Data   |         | Configuration    |
+------------------+         +------------------+         +------------------+
            |
            v
   Deployment Fails (Inconsistent)

```

### **Improved Workflow: Centralized Source Control**

```
+------------------+         +------------------+         +------------------+
| Developer A      |  --->   | Developer B      |  --->   | Git Repository   |
| Clones Repo      |         | Clones Repo      |         | All Assets       |
+------------------+         +------------------+         +------------------+
            |
            v
       Successful Deployment (Reproducible)

```

---

## **5. Auditability Visualization**

Version control provides an audit trail for all assets.

### Example: Git History

```
$ git log --all
commit 123456 (HEAD -> main)
Author: Developer A
Date: Dec 10, 2024
Message: Updated Terraform script for new environment

commit 654321
Author: Developer B
Date: Dec 08, 2024
Message: Fixed configuration for staging

commit 987654
Author: Developer C
Date: Dec 05, 2024
Message: Added new database schema

```

With version control, you can:

1. Track changes across all assets.
2. Roll back to any point in time (e.g., how the project looked 6 months ago).

---

## **6. GitOps Example**

In a **GitOps** setup, Git acts as the single source of truth for everything, including deployment automation. Changes are automatically applied to the infrastructure based on repository updates.

### Diagram: GitOps Workflow

```
+---------------------+
| Git Repository      |
| (Infrastructure IaC)|
+---------------------+
            |
            v
   CI/CD Pipeline Monitors Changes
            |
            v
+---------------------+
| Application Servers |
| Infra is Synced     |
+---------------------+

```

By ensuring that all project assets are version-controlled, organizations achieve a robust, scalable, and reliable development process, paving the way for smoother collaboration and faster deployments.
