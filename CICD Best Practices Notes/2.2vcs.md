# All Assets in VCS

The best practice of ensuring **"All Project Assets Are in Source Control"** emphasizes the importance of managing every component of a project lifecycle in a version control system, such as Git. This concept underlines the necessity of tracking, auditing, and maintaining the entire project environment to ensure reliability, transparency, and reproducibility. Here's a deeper breakdown of the principles:

---

## **1. Definition of "Project Assets"**

Project assets include all the files and resources necessary for the development, deployment, and maintenance of an application. This goes beyond just the source code and includes the following:

- **Source Code:** The actual codebase of the application.
- **Build Scripts:** Scripts that automate the process of building the application.
- **Pipeline Definitions:** CI/CD pipeline configurations that define how the application will be built, tested, and deployed.
- **Configuration Values:** Key-value pairs or environment variables that influence the behavior of the application across different environments.
- **Tests and Test Data:** Automated test scripts and data sets used to validate the application's functionality.
- **Database Schemas and Update Scripts:** The structure of the database and any scripts used to update or migrate it.
- **Infrastructure Definition Scripts:** Code files for infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, or Ansible.
- **Installation and Cleanup Scripts:** Scripts for setting up or tearing down application environments.
- **Documentation:** Any related manuals, guides, or project-specific instructions.

---

## **2. Why This Practice is Crucial**

Managing everything in source control ensures:

- **Consistency:** All project-related files are centrally located and maintained, reducing inconsistencies across environments.
- **Traceability:** Every change is recorded, making it easier to understand the evolution of the project and to audit changes.
- **Reproducibility:** With everything version-controlled, you can recreate the application in any environment using a consistent set of instructions and files.
- **Collaboration:** Multiple team members can work on the same project with a clear view of changes and dependencies.

---

## **3. Common Anti-Patterns**

- **Lack of Version Control:** Critical components like test data, configuration values, or deployment scripts are stored in untracked locations (e.g., local machines, wiki pages, or unmanaged servers).
- **Specialized Workflows:** Scripts or configurations exist only on specific machines, such as a developer's laptop or a bastion host, creating a dependency on an individual or a specific setup.
- **No Historical Context:** Without version control, there’s no way to trace back how the project looked in the past or why certain decisions were made.

Examples of these anti-patterns include:

- Deployment scripts saved only on "Jake’s Laptop."
- Configuration values documented in a company wiki but not synced with the project repository.

---

## **4. Benefits of Version Control**

- **Auditing:** Version control systems like Git provide a detailed history of all changes, including who made them and why.
- **Rollback Capabilities:** If something goes wrong, it's easy to revert to a previous stable state.
- **Uniformity Across Environments:** Ensures that the development, staging, and production environments are synchronized.
- **Team Independence:** Any team member can replicate the application locally or in an alternative environment without relying on specific individuals or infrastructure.

---

## **5. Best Practices**

- **Include All Assets:** Ensure that all files mentioned in the lifecycle of the application are version-controlled, from code to documentation.
- **Use Repositories Strategically:** Decide whether to use a monorepo (single repository) or polyrepo (multiple repositories). Both have pros and cons:
    - **Monorepo:** Easier to track all project components in one place but can become large and unwieldy.
    - **Polyrepo:** Promotes modularity but requires more effort to manage dependencies and integrations.
- **GitOps (Optional):** Use Git as the single source of truth for deployments and infrastructure changes. While not mandatory, it simplifies auditability and promotes declarative configuration management.

## **6. Implementation Steps**

1. **Audit Your Project Assets:** Identify all the files and resources that contribute to the application lifecycle.
2. **Set Up Version Control:** Use a system like Git, and establish clear guidelines for usage (e.g., commit messages, branch strategies).
3. **Automate Integrations:** Ensure CI/CD pipelines interact with the version-controlled files for building and deploying the application.
4. **Maintain Security:** Avoid committing sensitive information like passwords or access keys. Use tools like Git secrets or environment variable managers for secure handling.
5. **Regular Reviews:** Periodically review the repository to ensure all necessary files are included and organized.

## **7. Practical Example**

Imagine an organization deploying a web application. A robust setup following this best practice would look like:

- **Repository Structure:**
    - `src/` → Application source code
    - `scripts/` → Build and deployment scripts
    - `config/` → Configuration files for different environments (staging, production)
    - `tests/` → Unit and integration tests
    - `infra/` → Infrastructure scripts (e.g., Terraform or Ansible)
    - `docs/` → Documentation
- **Scenario: Recreating a Deployment:**
    - A new team member clones the repository.
    - By following the documentation and running the scripts in the repository, they can set up a local or cloud-based environment identical to production.

## **Conclusion**

Centralizing all project assets in a version control system is a foundational practice for achieving a robust, reliable, and collaborative development process. It eliminates dependencies on individual team members or specific machines, enhances traceability, and ensures that the application lifecycle is fully auditable and reproducible. Whether you are following GitOps or traditional workflows, version-controlling all resources is a non-negotiable best practice for any enterprise aiming for CI/CD excellence.
